PROJECT DESCRIPTION
	-"The 9 Gates of 112 "
	- A 2d mega man type game with a dope character selection UI and boss fights. 
COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS
	- some similar projects steven and connie vs the robot have the same main character vs enemy structure, I want 
	to have more attack and movement capabilities. I will have the same background picture idea. 15112 DarkKnight has similar player features
	When i turn direction the character profile will change, However my game will be from aside view not atop view. Street Fighter is similar in that 
	i am using a famous game iconn as the character. Also, i will have a character selection. I intend on having more characters to choose from.
 

STRUCTURAL PLAN
	- everything will be kept track of in a trello
	- base character will be an object file
	- each major scene will be a file
	- specific characters will be in diffent object files
	- charcter selction functions will be it own file
	- game file handles events and scene change
	
	
ALGORITHMIC PLAN 
	TOUGHEST PART _ Character Selection _ 
	- each character class will have a profile pic for selection
	- character class will have highlight method
	- pedestal object have  display character method that takes in current character
	- buttons to control movement and selection
	- buttons only select character spots, aka have the chars in a list and draw em
